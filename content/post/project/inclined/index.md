caption="Animation of a typical simulation with a binary separation of 80 au and inclination of 60 deg. The orbits of planetary embryos (denoted with the cyan spheres) were initially aligned with respect to the spin of the primary but finally aligned with respect to the binary orbit. The green arrows denote the normal lines of the primary spin plane (L_spin) and of the binary orbital plane (L_binary) respectively."
